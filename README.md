BEMOVED.JS
========
 
#### [Demo](http://apps.tweecode.com/custom/scrolltest/)
This project is inspired by Sony's [Be moved](http://www.sony.com/be-moved/) page.

Easily create stunning scrolling effects by mixing image sequence with web content. The best way to get started is to clone the repo and take a look at the code.

###Short note about the code
If you want to fork this(and please do) there are two main classes in this project  
BGMovie - is responsible for the canvas / image animation  
SpotLight - Takes the frame index from BGMovie and reveals elements in sync with the background animation.
